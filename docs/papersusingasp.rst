Papers that used ASP
====================

These works (papers and conference abstracts) have made use of the
Ames Stereo Pipeline to produce their results or enable their
studies. If something is missing, `let us know
<https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/issues/new?template=bibliography-addition---.md>`__,
we will add it!  You can also make a pull request directly to the
`papersusingasp.bib
<https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/blob/master/docs/papersusingasp.bib>`_
if you are familiar with GitHub and BibTeX.

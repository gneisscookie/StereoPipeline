HOW TO MAKE A RELEASE

Here's a developer's checklist for performing a binary Ames Stereo
Pipeline (ASP) release.

1.) Modify the build system:

Inside both the ASP and VW src/CMakeLists.txt set the new
version. After the last release (x.y.0), the ASP version is likely
x.y.0-alpha, and so you just need to change it to x.y.0 if this is a
feature release.  If this is a bugfix release or a major release
instead, then set the version number of the release appropriately (see
https://semver.org for guidance).


2.) Look up the latest ISIS version and update it in
    StereoPipeline/README.rst (see the "version" file in the packaged
    ASP tarball).

3.) Update NEWS.rst.

4.) Read and update the documentation.

5.) Commit all changes.

TODO(oalexan1): Steps 6 and 7 need to be updated.

6.) Build and package the software and documentation:

  - Fetch the latest ISIS. If necessary, update or rebuild our 
    conda dependencies to sync up with ISIS. (See INSTALLGUIDE.rst).
  - Build the documentation in StereoPipeline/docs/.

	make html
		tests building the online documentation

	make latexpdf
		builds 'the book'

  - Copy the obtained pdf file from docs/_build/latex/asp_book.pdf to
    BinaryBuilder/dist-add/asp_book.pdf.

7.) Build and package the ASP release tarball, see
    BinaryBuilder/README, section 3.B, part 2.

    Test all binary releases on different machines by running
    StereoPipelineTest.

NOTE: Step 7 is done automatically by running on lunokhod2 the script

  $HOME/projects/BinaryBuilder/auto_build/launch_master.sh

The resulting release tarballs will go to BinaryBuilder/asp_tarballs.

8.) Check that the ASP version is correct in the documentation
    file and that the documentation is searchable (this is a bug in
    some gs versions).

9.) Commit and tag the release in the VW and ASP repos. Example: 

  git tag 2.7.0

Push the tags to the remote server with: 

 git push origin 2.7.0 # commit to your branch
 git push god    2.7.0 # commit to main branch

If more commits were made and it is desired to apply this tag to a
different commit, first remove the exiting tag with:

  git tag -d 2.7.0
  git push origin :refs/tags/2.7.0
  git push god    :refs/tags/2.7.0

10.) Upload the builds and the pdf documentation to GitHub, in the
release area.

The 'forever' DOI on Zenodo is https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/714891
which should resolve to the 'latest' DOI.  A new DOI for *this* release of
ASP should be minted when the new tag is pushed to GitHub.

11.) Ask fellow ASP developers to do some tests and review the
documentation.

12.) Send an announcement of the new release to the mailing list, at
https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/ames-stereo-pipeline-support
and the old stereo-pipeline@lists.nasa.gov, listing the changes
specified in NEWS.rst.

13.) Modify the build system:

As a final step, after the release has been done, prep the repo for
the next phase of development, by updating the version number in:

	- configure.ac 
	- src/CMakeLists.txt

If you just released version 2.7.0, we expect that the next feature
release will be 2.8.0, if a major release, or 2.7.1 if a minor
release, so the version tag should be updated to 2.8.0-alpha in
anticipation (see https://semver.org for guidance).

14.) Reflect any changes in release policy by modifying this document.

15.) Commit changes.
